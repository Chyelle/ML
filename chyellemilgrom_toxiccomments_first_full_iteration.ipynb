      "Once one goes beyond the level of, say, The National Enquirer, the issue is not whether the source is reliable for any particular fact so much as whether the source is overweighting material that tends to attract more mass market interest.  Wikipedia was not created in order to just attract eyeballs.  The problem with, say, The Fox Nation, and The Huffington Post, in other words, is not that they lean right or left, respectively, but that they have a populist lean such that some discretion is in order.  For whatever reason, there is a lot more editor interest in adding (often without context), say, what O'Donnell said about mice with human brains on TV than there is interest in adding what a more \"\"boring\"\" politician like Mitch Daniels said to The Economist.  And there is undoubtedly more reader interest in O'Donnell than in Daniels as well.  But our obligation here is to be encyclopedic.  The Encyclopedia Britannica is often found in academic libraries where it is read by stuffy people who are more interested in an informative read than an entertaining one.   Beyond this, one has to ask how many quotes of this sort even Fox News or HuffPo would have if they were to have a single story on O'Donnell, which is what we are constructing here.  All this to say that an edit that introduced this quote would be considerably more likely to have a consensus supporting its inclusion if it replaced some other controversial, widely criticized or ridiculed remark by the article subject as opposed to adding to them.  \"\n",

      "I'm going on the soapbox for awhile, an uncomfortable position in a baseball game (sliding runners tend to knock it out from under you).  I want to explain my position without us getting personal.  If you take offense, apologies in advance.  And apologies for being so wordy.  Genetic defect.\n",

      "I am a baseball researcher by hobby (computer programmer by trade), and I take everything about baseball's history seriously, especially the Negro Leagues, which have become my area of expertise.  Segregation in Baseball remains the absolute worst scar on its face.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion (emphasis on it being my opinion), Josh Gibson, Pete Hill, Satchel Paige, Bullet Rogan, Oscar Charleston, Andy Cooper, José Méndez, Cristobal Torrienté, and many others men would have easily been Hall of Famers long, long ago had it not been for segregation.  It's my belief that given current evidence Gibson wouldn't have hit much more than 500 or so home runs playing a full schedule, given the HR rates of the 30s and 40s (not nearly as high as today), given his truncated career (he died after his 17th season), and given the position he played (catchers just don't play full schedules because of the extreme wear and tear; on the other hand, he might have been converted into an outfielder or first baseman in an integrated Majors, and 600+ would have been a possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Babe Ruth hit 714 Major League HRs; had he had to face Bullet Rogan, Andy Cooper, Satchel Paige, and other pitchers of color, his totals might have tailed down toward 650 or so, and that in a 22-year career compared to Gibson's 17.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we know is that Gibson is credited with 115 verifiable HR in Negro League play, plus 44 in Mexican League play, which was a bit lower level competition than MLB.  Gibson hit .359 against Negro League competition, which would be second highest of all time (behind Cobb) had he done so in an integrated majors, and Cobb's .366 might have lost a few points as well had he had to face Negro pitchers like Lefty Cooper and Willie Foster.\n",
      "\n",
      "The raw numbers are still small.  We can't do anything about that.  115 compares very badly to 714, much less 762.  But it's still important to know those numbers, because it's what he did against major league-level competition.  What he did against amateur and semi-pro competition in exhibition games is fun to know (if we truly did know), but it is not the true measure of his worth, and (IMO) it insults the man's memory to artificially pad his numbers.  Understanding that Babe Ruth hit HIS home runs in a league that played 154 games per season, that homers were easier to hit in Ruth's league than Gibson's (livelier baseballs in the AL), the relative numbers make Gibson look like Ruth's peer.\n",
      "\n",
      "With few exceptions, there are no researchers who do not believe that Josh Gibson was one of the two or three best pure power hitters in the game, and no exceptions among serious Negro League researchers.  We can (and in fact should) report that there have been various reports of his accomplishments in earlier days, but these numbers, taken without any context present a superman as unbelievable as that X-Files episode (\"\"The Unnatural\"\").\n",
      "\n",
      "You have to trust that the reason for putting up Gibson's reduced stats has a noble purpose.  Telling people that Gibson hit 800+ HR and batted .384 against all levels of competition tells nothing really, because he could have in reality hit .200 with no HR against top-level Negro League teams, but fattened up by counting 1,000 games against Little League comptetition.  Telling them he hit .359 and had a home run every sixteen at bats in a career that included many games in Griffith Stadium tells them something of importance  it gives us an excellent clue as to how he would have hit in the Majors, had he been allowed to play.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"\"nearly 800\"\" and \"\"962\"\" numbers give us no way of being able to separate them and understand their meaning.  An official scorer counted every one of Babe Ruth's HR in his major league career, and we can go back to sources from that day and find it.  In Gibson's case, someone reported (sometimes months later) numbers that no one even at that time could verify, because a lot of the numbers were based on hearsay, and some were just plain made-up.  We can't tell how many he hit over a 150-foot fence against a 17-year-old kid with a 60 MPH fastball, because we can't separate them.\n",

There is much room for further revision (and since the lead, among many other things, was not written by me, I would have no objection to revision of it).  My comments were directed to the deliberate removal of all my references to primary source documents, and to the perception that Pearson and Nelson's books are reliable sources.  In some respects they are, but both books also contain egregious factual errors, and they cannot be cited without checking the 'facts' cited in them against the primary source documents.  Your comment that the transcripts and translations on my site are 'not considered a reliable source for information' puzzles me.  If you can demonstrate to me that anything in any one of my transcripts does not accurately reflect the content of the document in question, I'll be happy to change it.  I've striven to make the summaries as accurate as possible, and I think they are accurate.  Moreover my transcripts have the advantage of being in modern spelling, and are thus accessible to everyone, which the original documents certainly are not, being in Latin, and in various Elizabethan scripts.  As for what you term the 'glosses' and which I term 'summaries', their purpose is to summarize the sometimes very obscure content of the documents for readers, and to refer readers to other related documents on the same topic which they might not otherwise be aware of.  The 'glosses' (summaries) are thus a very valuable resource for readers.  But again, if you can find any instance in which one of my summaries misrepresents the content of a document, please let me know and I'll change it.  Re the Brinknell incident.

He feels he has the right to discredit all studies he disagrees with, and that everyone should accept his theories as absolute fact.  I could just as easily creat a website presenting an opposite view and discrediting studies that Racial Reality likes.  But I am not that dishonest.  My point was to present the other side of the story, while leaving Racial Reality's also valid side there as well; in this way, the reader can draw his or her own conclusions.

This fact doesn't discredit older studies that use blood groups, since the blood groups and blood proteins used are specific to certain populations.  Since the decoding of the human genome, we have access to more sensitive methods of determing admixture.  \n",

      "An example of how blood groups studies are valid is the Duffy null marker. The Duffy blood-group types have been known for many decades, as has their usefulness in identifying continent of ancestry. But it has been only within the past decade that we have known that a person's Duffy blood-group type is encoded on the long arm of his/her chromosome #1, about 23.2 centimorgans out from the chromosome's centromere. \n",

The latter is more precise since some proteins are produced (or not) only in homozygotes and so are invisible to serological analysis but visible in the DNA. If anything, serological analysis will understimate true admixture. \n",

Five percent or more is usually considered statistically significant.\n",

      "The Calo study presents support for the east-west division in Sicily, and shows relatedness between Sicilians and Egyptians.  Egyptians were imported to Sicily during the Saracen period as farmers, so the connection between Sicilians and Egyptians is not spurious. The study's use of perfectly valid blood group and mtDNA studies which show sub-Saharan admixture in Sicily were merely to show that other studies found \"\"African\"\" admixture there, regardless of whether it was sub-Saharan or North African.  There are other studies which lump the two together. The whole point was to show a relationship with the (diverse) peoples of the continent of Africa.\n",

      "The Semino study from 1989 which found 4 sub-Saharan haplotypes out of a population of 91 diverse Sicilians is not \"\"problematic,\"\" as Racial Reality would have us believe, but is a perfectly valid mtDNA study using restriction enzymes, a method still widely used today, since it is cost-effective and accurate.  RFLP's cut the DNA at specified locations, and \"\"indels\"\" (insertion and deletions polymorphisms) are very easy to spot in this way. There are other studies that have found less (or in one case, no) sub-Saharan material in the Sicilian gene pool.  This is normal, since all samples are different, and because of this, all tests will yield different results.  One certainly can't \"\"refute\"\" or \"\"overrule\"\" the other.  The 2001 Vona study (finding no sub-Saharan genes in Sicilians) that referenced the 1989 Semino study did so for comparison purposes only.  Furthermore, it tested only 49 Siclians from the single villige of Alia.  No reliable conclusions can be reached for the Sicilian population as a whole from such a narrow sample.  Dr. Ornella Semino, a former colleage of mine, found it both amusing and a bit disturbing when I mentioned to here that certain non-professional forum posters considered her study \"\"outdated\"\" or \"\"overruled\"\" or \"\"refuted\"\"  all absolute drivel!\n",

      "Here's a situation I found intriguing. The JIDF blog specifically posted an image to put on this Wikipedia article. The heading currently reads \"\"Better Sample of the Groups We Target (For Wikipedia).\"\" This strikes me as problematic. At the very least, it gives the appearance of Wikipedia coordinating with JIDF to promote JIDF, or cooperating with JIDF's self-promotion. (From what I can tell, our image is downloaded from the blog image by Einsteindonut 8-22-08.) I'm sorry if you've already come to consensus about the inclusion of the image in the article, but I did want to mention this interesting nuance. Best wishes,  | Talk \n",
      "I don't like the way the JIDF is manipulating this article, posting messages for Wikipedia that are then being used as sources. I wish there was some way to put an end to it, but I think a blog is a WP:RS for what it says about the organization that sponsors it. — Malik Shabazz (talk · contribs) \n",
      "\n",
      " Hm. That's interesting.  The JIDF is only marginally notable (only two major press citations have been found), and being in Wikipedia increases the visibility of the organization. Wikipedia usually doesn't display web site screen shots. Usually an article gets a logo, if that. Also, we have a third-party cartoon in that image without copyright clearance.  Maybe we should drop that image.      \n",

      "At this juncture, Malik, their opinion about whether to be on Wikipedia strikes me as irrelevant. (I'm assuming that WP:BLP does not apply to organizations, right?) However, if the screenshot is unusual for an article of this size, then I'd be interested in hearing the pro's and con's for keeping the image.

      "The Anti-Defamation League, AIPAC, and CAMERA Wikipedia pages don't have screenshots.

The page for Facebook has a picture of Facebook HQ (although, amusingly, that picture is actually of the Japanese restaurant that occupies the ground floor) and a screen shot of the home/login page.  Miniclip has a screen shot of their huge home page in their info box. LinkedIn just has a logo.  Myspace has a logo and a picture of the headquarters building. None of these Wikipedia pages have screenshots of interior web site pages. Wikipedia doesn't usually do that.    \n",
      "But John, this image serves a different function. It displays the Facebook groups that were the target of JIDF activities. So it seems directly related to the notable aspect of the group's activity. Is it relevant that the screenshot is taken from the JIDF Facebook page or blog sites?

      "First off let's be clear, this is a proposed merger not a deletion. Looking at your argument of other stuff exists, the only HD specific example that you have mentioned (List of DirecTV local channels with HD) compares the availability of affiliated HD channels between cities, not a million miles away from this page comparing channel availability between platforms. The other examples that you have given are lists per platform, as you said. The fact is HD channels on Sky do form a part of Sky Digital and not another platform called Sky+ HD, HD channels are clearly labelled on List of channels on Sky Digital as being in HD were applicable. There is absolutely no distinction in the amount of HD content shown, if it simulcasts with an SD channel etc. on the same channel between platforms. There is no need for a list of channels in a certain broadcast format on a certain platform and it seems like content forking and listcruft. You also mentioned size, labelling this page as potentially \"\"unwieldy\"\", there are clear guidelines for the size of articles and compared to the other lists that you mentioned, this page could double in size without problems. If you want to talk long term, then in the future it's likely that being in HD or knowing if a channel uses up-scaling won't be especially notable just as being in 16:9 or using widescreen switching or stretching/zooming isn't today and at some point this page could also end up being merged or otherwise. By the way, there is a List of television stations in the United Kingdom (foreign versions may be found at Lists of television channels) and I agree that it is somewhat impractical for certain tasks. As for Andrewcrawford's actions, Help:Merging explains that \"\"If you think merging something improves the encyclopaedia, you can be bold and perform the merger, as described below. Because of this, it makes little sense to object to a merger purely on procedural grounds, e.g. \"\"you cannot do that without discussion\"\" is not a good argument. If the merger is controversial, however, you may find your merger reverted, and as with all other edits, edit wars should be avoided. If you are uncertain of the merger's appropriateness, or believe it might be controversial, or your merger ends up reverted, you can propose it on either or both of the affected pages.\"\" A proposal had been made in August 2008. \"\"If there is clear agreement with the proposal by consensus, or if there is silence, proceed with the merger.\"\" There was silence so he did nothing wrong. With regards to DarkLight748, he did not post any kind of edit summary with his edit, since Andrew does not a appear to be a regular contributor to List of HD channels on Sky+ HD he could have perceived that as vandalism and vice versa. -   \"\n",

      "Kelly knew what color her eyes were when she made the song \"\"Behind These Hazel Eyes\"\". Comparing the pictures of Kelly and Belle, they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it - Belle's eyes are little lighter. Someone made a video called \"\"Behind Belle's Hazel Eyes\"\", the person who made this video knew what color Belle's eyes were and decided to include Belle's name in the title. And if you read the comments, the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like \"\"green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved\"\". I like the \"\"problem solved\"\" part. With Minotaurgirl's bias against the idea of Belle having hazel eyes, I think there will always be a problem with people like her involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "TV Tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her, so much so they forbade users from writting what Belle's eye color is. Notice how Belle's name is missing from the Eye Color tropes colony, while the rest of Disney Princesses have their eye color mentioned. Belle's name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki. This is Minotaurgirl's account, as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite, the reason; inserting false information, the false information being writting down Belle's eyes as brown.] And now here's Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia. Is there any repsite from her?\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed she has a Live Journal account. See what she has written. The lack of links speaks for itself. She thinks she actually proved Belle's eyes are brown, depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie, like the screenshots she send me. By magnifying the images, you can see her eyes are hazel-colored and not the same color as her hair at all. Notice how she's afriad to use close-ups of Belle's eye cuz she knows they'll appear hazel if she did so, thus disproving her. On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote \"\"Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?\"\" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone deserves to be blocked, it's Minotaurgirl. If it wasn't for her bias, sites like like TV Tropes, Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn't have suffered an edit war about Belle's eye color. The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "My overall opinion on Minotaurgurl. I think it's safe to say the interent is better off without her. She's toxic, she's a nuisance, she's talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her, she lies, she mangles, twists and misrepresents other people's words, and she causes edit wars. Action needs to be taken against people like this.  \"\n",

Izak love, when you don't know something, that does not make it balony.   PS, I haven't been \"\"studying\"\" Satmer - I am one, and my maternal grandfather referes to his birthplace as Sakmer (AKA Satu Mare). PPS There is no KJ street called Sakmer. The photo you attached clearly dubbs the Satmar Rabbi \"\"The Rav of Sakmer\"\". For those who study Satmer but have no knowledge of the script which the Satmers use, the word is the one at the lower left corner looking something like this: סאקמער.

      "I revised the opening paragraph by indicating the Satmars are one of the largest hasidic groups - it is widely thought there are about 200,000 Lubavitchers, but since none of the hasidic groups keeps a formal membership role, this is all conjecture - it would be incorrect for any group to claim they are the largest, there is no way of knowing. \n",

I actually asked a chaver of the Satmar Beis Din about the Cherem, and he said it's nonsense. The Beis DIn has not publicly issued a cherem against a person or group of people since its formation in the United States. No denunciation was issued either.

The aggressor intended to crush Eastern Armenia and seize Transccaucasia. When Alexandropol fell, the Turkish Army poured into the Ararat Valley – the heart of Armenia.

Moreover, now it sounds even ridiculous.The same thing they wrote twice. Just by cutting and pasting from the history of the article. These kids who never went to school in Armenia, whose knowledge about Armenian history comes from church sunday schools write things that can couse laugh even in Turkish readers. For example, in early May recently becamed independent Armenia was attacked by Ottoman forces ( Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan decalred their independence only in the end of May). Or, after losing the battle of Sardarapat, Armenia declared its independence (second time as a matter of fact). But we all know that the second time Armenia declared its Sovetization (occupation by bolsheviks) on November 29,1920 and not independence. It is very well known that the commander in the battle of Sardarapat was Daniel Bek Pirumov from the village of Nakhichevanik in Nagorno Karabakh. SO fat these 2 imbeciles named Nareklm and roob keep pushing the name Slkuni or Silician.  And finall,y who needs the aftermath of the battle in Sardarapat if it concludes information about what Georgia did, who it asked for help etc etc etc. I am surprized to find out from the article edited by roob and narek that Turkish army occupied the whole Armenia(including Russian part which is todays Armenia). Probably Nagorno Karabakh or Zangezur or Sevan they do not consider a part of Armenia anymore. Moreover, in the history of this article also edited by some turks and Narek you can find out that Armenia was forced to sign treaty of Batumi!!!!!You can see how come 3 not literate (angraget in Armenian) imbeciles can come and do things in wikipedia that Turkish and Azeri propagandists could not even see in their dreams. Because these 3 imbeciles have got a right to revert edit or even block others, the real Armenian history specialists can get heart attacks if they read this article.

To quote the Wikipedia article on shepherds, \"\"A shepherd is one who takes care of sheep, usually in flocks in the fields... Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners, being paid to watch the sheep of others.\"\" The 1960s weren't Biblical times. Shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that down-and-out laborers got when they could get it. In fact, that's an important part of Proulx's story, characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. Calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.\n",

Afterwards Ennis worked with cattle and Jack worked most of his life in an office job (not as a \"\"rodeo cowboy\"\" to whoever made that remark). However, the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer, the summer that so defined them. Therefore, I'd say that the relevant description, especially in this paragraph discussing THAT SUMMER, would be shepherds. That, however, is more up for debate. I would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. Although anybody who's ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that that's just a circumlocution for shepherd. But since I don't want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page, I'll settle for that as a compromise. Chris \n",

Secondly I agree with Mr.. -Definition of Muslim upon which all Muslim scholars agree is \"\"Muslim\"\" means a person who believes in the unity and oneness of Almighty Allah, in the absolute and unqualified finality of the Prophet hood of Muhammad, the last of the prophets, and does not believe in, or recognize as a prophet or religious reformer, any person who claimed to be a prophet in any sense of the word or of any description, whatsoever, after Muhammad. All suni/shia scholars agree on this definition. For more detail you can see the authenticated books of both sunni's and shia's, you will find same words. But Ahmadis call Mr.Ghulam Ahmad there Prophet as stated here: Prophethood (Ahmadiyya). Thats the reason they are not allowed to call themselves as Muslim. Other Muslim countries do not declared them non-Muslims but Pakistan because this movement was started in India/Pakistan. India do not declared them non-Muslim officially because India is not an Islamic country, but all Muslim scholars of India consider them as non-Muslims. Hope so it clarifies. Discuss © \"\n",

Later, the other officer (the one who wrote the report) confirmed this to me personally. He decided against including this in the report since he didn't think it was all that relevant and he didn't want to get in trouble with his supervising officer over what might be construed as a joke in bad taste (apparently he and his supervisor didn't get along).\n",

I will try to persuade you instead as you are obviously a person of some mathematical sophistication who can appreciate my point. The Laplace transform does not resolve a function into its moments because for no value of s does L(s) correspond to a moment; I think the person who orginally posted that statement must have thought that was the case (e.g. they thought it was the Mellin transform).  There are further transformations you can do that would reveal the moments, but that would define a different integral transform that is different from the Laplace transform (in fact, for any integral transform we can apply its inverse and then the Mellin transform and get the moments, so this isn't unique to the Laplace transform).  The exponential change of variables is not relevant because then we are not talking about the moments of the original function but the transformed version.

Economic theory is very abstract, and even myself, with a MSc in the field soon in my pocket, finds it difficult to understand the matters at hand. The use of an unnecessary complex prose makes things even worse. The art of writing an encyclopædia is not to get other economists to undestand the matter at hand, but to explain it to a lay person at high school level. For instance, the phrase \"\"Most taxes distort economic decisions\"\" means abosultely nothing to most people. The next sentence uses a lot of complex words, and introduces many technical terms in the sentance; for instance, i doubt most people know what 'dissuaded', 'correlation', 'levy', 'fallacious' and 'marginal' means. Rememerb, economists can go elsewhere for an academic description of the topic, while our purpose here is to provide information to the masses. I would recommend completely rewriting the section.

      " While there are some surface similarities between racial hygiene and ethnic cleansing, I believe that the concept of racial hygiene did not play a major role in the expulsions documented in this article.\n",
      "\n",
      " The major unique feature of racial hygiene is the concept of race and genetics (eugenics).  This concept argues that you are who you are by dint of your parents race and genetics and that what you think and how you act is irrelevant to the \"\"pollution\"\" caused by your inferior genes.  Thus, Hitler could argue for an Aryan super-race that was polluted by Jewish, Slavic and other inferior races.  If you had any forebears from a non-Aryan race, you were suspect.\n",
      "\n",
      " In contrast, ethnic cleansing is more about removing those of a different ethnicity where ethnicity is usually marked by language, religion and customs.  Those considered to be a different ethnicity might be of the same race (e.g. Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda).  It is hard to argue that Poles and Germans are of different races unless you are a Nazi.  To most people, they are just different ethnicities of the Caucasian race.  It is similarly hard to argue that the various ethnic groups (Serbs, Croats, Bosnians) in the the former Yugoslavia are of different races.  As far as I know, the major differences are language and religion.\n",
      "\n",
      " As a thought experiment, consider the case of a German woman married to a Polish man in the first half of the 20th century.  If the family spoke Polish at home and raised their children as Poles (i.e. Polish-speaking Catholics), would that family have been expelled?  I doubt it.  If you agree, then you can see that the expulsions of ethnic Germans may have been motivated by ethnic cleansing but not by racial hygiene.\n",

      "\"\"Blue balls\"\" is a modern slang term for a minor cramping men may get in the groin after they are sexually stimulated for a prolonged period but do not ejaculate.\n",

      "Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary conforms to common sense usage in saying a cramp is \"\"a painful spasmodic muscular contraction\"\", and the groin does have muscles.  But blue balls is not a cramp, but an ache in the testicles (whose musculature is insignificant at most).  Ellis emphasizes \"\"congestion\"\", which i take to imply that the pain reflects failure to release the eleveated local blood pressure resulting from failure to relieve the engorgement of the genitals that is crucial to erection, i.e., a condition related to the \"\"pain and tenderness\"\" of priapism.  (It may be informative to consult side-effects information of Viagra and its competitors, some of which are effective for 3 days and advise medical care for erections lasting over 4 hours.)

      "Further, the term ejaculate, like the earlier \"\"release semen\"\" (that a well-intentioned editor  used to replace simply \"\"release\"\"), misleadingly suggests that fluid pressure of seminal fluid is at issue; i think research will show that there is no significant seminal pressure except that imposed in pulses by the prostate during ejaculation.  The real issue is indeed plain \"\"release\"\", or rather release of either sympathetic or parasympathetic (never could remember which is which) nervous-system excitation, which in turn entails destimulation of sphincter-like structures that sustain the engorgement (and that ED-medications work by affecting).\n",

After all the fear for the worse, prayers and the pains she went through, the operations was successful and all was well again. She started gaining back her weight, cracking jokes and doing every continued living normally.\n",

      "She has to go through a one month of the radiotherapy treatment, 6 mins per day. Monday to Friday every week. Now she's lost plenty of weight, loss of appetite, always in pain, vomiting and diarrhea and every radiotherapy symptoms you can think of. By now, the fear in the family is intensely growing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe a patient in that kind of situation should be in an intensive care of the hospital in question, but eko hospital sent her home with some paracetamol. They said, in the next couple of weeks she would be fully okay and they insisted in her continuation of the treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "By now, everything you can think of is happening to this little girl, she's as skinny as you can describe it. From time to time she asks if she's going to survive this, and everyone around her said yes based on what they were told at Eko Hospital, one person accidentally said, \"\"madam I'll tell you the truth, your day is doomed and she will not make it, just take her home and pray for the rest of her life.\"\" patient mother confronted the doctors with this matter and they said that \"\"the head nurse that shared that information does not work in their department and knows nothing about what she's talking about\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "To cut the very long story short, on the 2nd of October, yesterday, she has to be rushed into the hospital, she said \"\" I don't want to stay at home, I want to be in the hospital, I believe I will be okay when we get to the hospital\"\" When they got to the nearest hospital to their home, they refused her why, because they do not have loads of cash at hand at that moment in time, they progressed further to the next hospital where they required instant deposit as well. Then finally progressed to a further hospital where instant cash is also required.\n",
      "\n",
      "She herself begged the last doctor, because she doesn't want to go home. Now the time is 1.am all at home trying to make this poor girl comfortable as she was in pain all over, this is a very bright 19 year old girl for God's Sake. 2 am, now she's now twitching all over, and mumbling some word we do not understand. the last sensible sentence she made was \"\"you, you, you have new clothes, I'm happy for you o, I will tell my daddy and my mummy they will buy clothe for me too\"\"\n",

      "\n",

      " I was thinking about this last night, and came to two conclusions: First, focusing solely on this article is not the way to go. I need to go back to square one and add academic rigor (if possible) to global warming and denialism. [Don't tell me GW is FA and is therefore academically rigorous; the FA star does not even come within discus-throwing distance of establishing an article as \"\"academically rigorous.\"\"]. Second, your system of defending this Wikipedia page (notice I didn't say \"\"article\"\") is completely airtight, because you hold control over all of the definitions. Join any high school debate team and they'll tell you, if you own the definitions, you own the debate. And the problem here is this: you define anyone who disagrees with AGW as a \"\"denialist\"\"; and you define everyone who agrees with you as an \"\"expert.\"\" Done! The page is impregnable. Take forex the quote by Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. Using her comments as supporting evidence of the page's (not \"\"article's) thesis is a flagrant act of POV that proves this page (not \"\"article\"\") is an op-ed piece from start to end. Barbara Boxer is a politician. Every bit of power, money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only: to characterize herself as a noble public servant, and stereotype her opponents as villains, buffoons or both. Even more — and this is important — Barabara Boxer is not a run-of-the-mill politician. It would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is. In short, the Boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the \"\"so what?\"\" test. I intend to delete that one sometime soon too. I also wonder whether I should give one of those damn wikicookie templates as a thank-you to the editors who revert me, every time they do so. Or maybe a barnstar?

Contrast \"\"the Big Apple\"\" for New York City, a nickname with which virtually all Americans and probably most native English speakers are familiar.  belongs in a city article's infobox (and maybe its lead).

Any dominance that England had in the Union was Parliamentary, whilst the Royal family was a Scottish dominance.  It was a good trade-off in principal, but failed to satisfy all partisans in practice.  You deny all charges of Calvinists that the Stuarts attempted to impose universal Anglican uniformity in the British Isles?

Yes, I know that if it is wrong, I could just update it myself; but it looks like this will require a bit of rearrangement which I'm not quite in the mood to sort out now, and so it is best for me to give a brief statement of the issue here.

      "The problem is a terminological confusion which arises from using the term pullback for different (but related) things. For f  M → N a smooth map, there is usually not a smooth bundle map from T*N to T*M (unless f is a diffeomorphism). There is a pointwise map of individual cotangent spaces f*p  Tf(p) N → Tp M for every p, defined by operation with the pushforward of a vector in the corresponding tangent space (it is the transpose of the pushfoward on individual tangent spaces). But for the general point q in N we can't pull back to M unless we have a way of choosing a point in f-1(q) (which is especially problematic if f is not onto...). However, we can pull back sections of the cotangent bundle (i.e. covector field, and this applies in general to covariant tensor fields). The \"\"pullback\"\" everyone talks about is a map from covector fields on N to covector fields on M, that is, given ω: N → T*N a section, we define f*ω  M → T*M  by\n",
      "\n",
      "where f*p is just the pointwise pullback defined before. This is always well-defined. Note that this is just the opposite of the problem with vectors and their fields (and in general, contravariant tensor fields): in that case, there is a pushforward which is a smooth bundle map of the tangent bundles, but in general vector field does not push forward unless the map is a diffeomorphism. It has been remarked in several books that the co-objects seem to have this wonderful extra structure, of being able to pull back sections. What really happened is that it gave up the capability to induce a smooth bundle map of the bundles in the process, thus restoring one aspect of \"\"duality\"\" that seems to have been broken when dealing with this subject.\"\n",

It demonstrates not only that medical practitioners are taking Post-Finasteride Syndrome seriously but also informs to those who may be suffering from negative persistent side effects from Propecia and Proscar that there are current ongoing studies.  While it may not be apparent on this Wikipedia article because JDWOLFF is very aggressive to remove comments he doesn't like, there is an ongoing controversy relating to the side effects of taking Propecia.  Many men have disregarded the claims since a handful of doctors remain ignorant to the potential risks of the drug and have been misinforming their patients only to lead additional patients to suffer what seems to be permanent side effects.  Please state your case as to why the information about the conference should not be included or else I would put it back up.\n",

      "But this is like saying we had to wait until 2012 so we could post a photograph of J.D. Salinger on his article (btw, they used a Fair-use provision long before that). They are both people who were alive, but are inaccessible to the general public for the foreseeable future. He may or may not (depending on your definiton, or how you believe Kim Jong-Un lives like) be a recluse, but the only images that are made of him come from KCNA. And he isnt going to be giving selfies to his adoring fans anytime soon, or to anyone for that matter, much less to somebody who is willing to release a content of him for Free-Use or CC. So I dont understand how someone can come to the conclusion that the leader of North Korea is a figure who is not in a position inacessible to the genenral public. Are we supposed to wait until Kim Jong Un dies before we can get a fair-use provision? Or are we making conclusions that because somebody might be able to take a photograph of him in an unspecified future timeframe, fair-use is rendered incompatible with any content depicting him. Im not usually involved in license debates, but I seriously think this is already one of the worst world leader articles ive seen in a while and the lack of image is a huge part of it (he is currently the only world leader who is missing an image).\n",

What is \"\"famous\"\" to you is not \"\"famous\"\" to me, and vice versa.  So either we liberally add the word throughout every article, to describe anything that could be considered by anyone to be \"\"famous\"\", or we don't use it at all, unless it was used in a quote or other trivial exceptions.

To be clear, Government funded sources include academia, and they are also less verifiable if not freely accessible.  What makes basic income special is that, unlike virtually every other political proposition, the Champion of basic income gains no privilege whatsoever over other citizens, and so the only reason to champion UBI is to provide freedom and dignity to everyone.  The relevance is that there is no business model for power accumulation behind it, and that affects the sources available.  Limiting information sources to entrenched power sources (Government, academia and corporate) stacks the deck with biased point of view in favour of power structures, or in the case of the state of this page, makes it impossible to describe UBI.

They were followed up in 1912 by the Ms class, only difference being the Ms class were superheated. So they were also the first class of Garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. Both classes were built by Beyer-Peacock.\n",

The VR G class apparently is copied from the Ms class, the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. Outside framed Garratts are very rare, even in the smaller gauges. But wait there is more (no, not steak knives!). The design was used again, for the Australian Portland Cement's 3'6\"\" line near Geelong, the first loco being supplied in 1936 and the second in 1939. The boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored G42.\n",

Did Horton have pain  killers in his system or not?? This information on this page does not provide the answer and just confuses the reader.\n",

Even though there appears shrines and a tree with a shimenawa, it doesn't mean that Totoro has shintoist themes because you can see shinto shrine everywhere in Japan. Regarding appearance of shrine as Shintoism is just a misunderstanding by foreigners who have little knowledge of the Japanese way of religion. Obake has nothing to do with shinto either. No Japanese people regard obake as a part of shinto. If you call Totoro religious, almost all Japanese anime and manga will be religious. Do you call Inuyasha religious just because Kagome lives in a shrine? Or do you call Yu Yu Hakusho religious because Yusuke became a ghost and there're many yokais in the show? Or do you say Shrek has Christian themes just because there's a church? Calling something shintoism just because it is traditional is nonsense. Even if Totoro seems to have shintoist themes to the westerners' eyes, it just means Totoro is a movie set in the Japanese countryside and it is nothing worthy of special mention.  \n",
      "\n",
      "You may believe most Japanese people are shintoist, but it is not necessarily true. They go to shrine on New Year's Day not because they believe in shinto but simply beacuse it is Japanese tradition. The same thing can be said about the appearance of the shrine in Totoro. The appearance of shinto shrine or that of obake cannot be connected to shinto. Believe it or not, it is true that there's no Japanese word for \"\"shintoist\"\" although there is the word for \"\"Buddhist\"\", bukkyouto. In other words, Japanese people don't regard them something like \"\"shintoist\"\". To Japanese, shinto is not something you believe in or you don't blieve in. There's no bible or dogma. Shinto is nothing like Christianity, Islam or Buddhism. It is even doubtful whether it is proper to say that shinto is a religion. \n",

      "True, Totoro is not religious, but there are significant Shinto themes throughout the film. The Totoro are forest/nature spirits, the tree where they live is part of a shrine, and so on. Having Shinto themes does not mean Miyazaki was trying to get across some religious point. Rather, I imagine he was trying to evoke images of a lost past (as it is set in the 1950s) when things were simpler, and trying to get people to remember their roots and not forget their traditions. As you wrote yourself, Shinto is not so much a religion anymore (except to a very few), but more of a set of traditions with some religious elements. Totoro can have Shinto elements without being a religious film. I don't think anyone is arguing the film is religious. You're the only one who's said anything about that.

      "To ERS and others. I think LK's frustration appears to stem from a personal belief of injustice in that he believes the link to templars.org.uk website is being removed with an inconsistent approach to the Wikipedia policies. This article does contain links to other websites that contain a great deal of unchecked or unverified information and it appears that he seems to want a level playing field. But I have emailed him privately to ask that he puts his position a little more diplomatically and I will the first to edit or scorn any more sarcasm. Equally, having looked at the history of changes, Elonka does need to show some consistency here and apply these hard and fast rules to other links if appropriate. That inconsistency could easily be interpreted as a personal grudge, hence the obvious friction. The question of external links is quite clear in Wikipedias's policies. If a site offers reliable resource material or is a good point of reference that is relevant to the article, then it can be included in line with those polices. I have briefly read the history section of LK's link and it does appear to be good information and is also well set out. It is neat, tidy and well formatted. This does perhaps seem curious to LK where some of the other links here have all sorts of advertising pop-ups and ticker-clickers with an obvious advertising and revenue bias. You state that you want proof of the charitable nature of the site but has that also been queried of the other sites that are plastered in adverts? Again, consistency needs to apply to prevent stoking of the fire. I will therefore check the Charities Commission entry for this organisation and see what their accounts say. That will clearly show if the management of the organisation is drawing any financial gain which would put in a clear COI position if added in by him. But, does that totally exclude a site if it still provides good reference material. One could argue that Microsoft's website should not be referenced from the article on Windows as it is a clear commercial entity. LK has pointed out Elonka's own entry page, but perhaps not in a very complimentary fashion. On that page she has included links to her own site which does feature an advertisement to her book. So I come back to the level playing field issue. If you want to play referee you have to enforce the rules to both sides or one side will feel rightly peeved. I review and edit history books for a living especially those in this sector of interest and I am particularly noted for the integrity of data and cross-checking references. Elonka has stated that she objects to the link on the basis that it is not reliable, although there is no further detail as to what precisely. Therefore I will offer to read the entire website, especially the history section in detail, and see if there is anything factually incorrect, controversial or just plain stupid. Maybe one solution would be to generate a totally separate article on modern orders. But the fundamental matter is still whether the website is a good reference point. If it is, and the history details concur with published knowledge and this article, then it probably deserves its place.  Maybe even more than some of the other links here that, perhaps, have not been subject to such a review? I don’t know because I haven’t read through those others. To be frank, it is quite silly that so much effort has been expended on this personal battle between the two of them and this debate over one web link. They could both contribute a lot to make this article a potential featured article. Who knows, they might even become best of friends in developing a fantastic article on a subject that we all enjoy. I will help out with proof reading and trying to make some of the writing flow a little better if that's okay with everyone.\n",

For if the British capital could be reduced to chaos, the task of the invading armies would be enormously simplified (...) 'The British', he screeched, 'drop their bombs indiscriminately and without plan on civilian residential quarters and farms and villages. For three months I did not reply because I believed that they would stop, but in this Mr. Churchill saw a sign of our weakness. The British will know that we are now giving our answer night after night. We shall stop the handiwork of these night pilots.' Three days later, on 7th September, the Luftwaffe abandoned its offensive against the sector stations and began the assault on London.

PS I accept the 'Beyond the Pale\"\" comment with the greatest pride, and would believe my \"\"Get your grubby hands off my country's name\"\" attitude to this article is part of the finest historical tradition of all, a tradition from the glens of Wicklow in 1580 to Cath Chéim an Fhia in 1822 to the Bogside in 1969 which I am speechless with pride about.

It takes various forms depending on what the government decides to do, naturally; the more religious-theocratic the government, the more likely it'll be a full branch of the police or even its own group. Take its incarnation in Saudi Arabia and compare it to the village enforcement groups found in northern Pakistani villages, for instance. Or the versions in Egypt and Yemen, which have (at least at this point) more to do about making sure that the only version of Islam practiced is the state-sponsored one.

      "\n",
      "I think the pic of a 1979 Austin Allegro is actually a Vanden Plas either 1500 or 1750 model. You can tell by the raised grille attached to the bonnet - the VP was a luxury (sic) version of the Allegro mark 2 model produced between 1975 and 1979. It had a classic wood and leather interior including walnut picnic tables recessed into the backs of the front seats, and the different frontal treatment you can see hints of in the pic. The VP was something of a freak - who was it aimed at in marketing terms and did anyone ever associate Allegros with luxury motoring? It was probably produced because Ford was having big success with the Ghia versions of some of its models, upgraded and laden with extras for which a premium price was charged, and cash-strapped BL was desperate for some of the action. The reason for raising this is that VPs weren't actually badged as Austins (or Allegros for that matter), but sold as a separate marque albeit through the same BL dealderships,so the pic shouldn't appear on the Austin history page cos it isn't.

The reality was that there was only a handful of Templars in Scotland at the time the Order was dissolved, and Robert I was not about to risk further papal censure by interfering.

      "\"Okay, I understand that the encyclopedia needs to describe things in a way that reflects the industry standards, so I'm not disputing this Wiki's use of which connector type is \"\"male\"\" vs. \"\"female.\"\" But I am, however, still just curious about it. These are my questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. With other cables I've seen, the MALE end is the one where there is a center pin or set of pins plugging into a jack where there's a receiving hole in the center, whether or not there's also a female-like sheathe of some kind around the connector pins. For examples: coaxial cables (F, RCA, etc.), DIN cables (S-video, some older rounded computer cable plugs, etc.), \"\"D\"\" plugs, and DVI. Of course there would be others, too. Okay, so the one with the pins has been male, while the one that the pins plug into is female, even if the one with the holes fits into an outer casing that the one with the pins is in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, that's been true up until HDMI came out, apparently. Look at HDMI and what the industry is calling its \"\"female\"\" and \"\"male\"\" ends. They're calling the end with the pin row the female end, and the end with the slot that the row of pins plugs into the \"\"male\"\" end (and keep in mind that the end with the bar of pins is also the end with a female-like casing around it, just as I pointed out above, yet those above like that are still MALE; yes, the slotted end of HDMI sort-of plugs into the sheathed-like end, but then so do several of those others I mentioned above which were always called FEmale, because what really counts has been the PINS, not the edges. So why isn't HDMI's PIN end the one called MALE like the others?\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Who is it in the industry that first insisted that this slotted end of HDMI should be called backwards of other kinds of plugs, the \"\"male\"\" end, and that the end with the pins in the middle should be called backwards of other connectors, the \"\"female\"\" end? Who from the industry started that and sort-of \"\"dictated\"\" to encyclopedias, etc. that this is \"\"how it's supposed to be,\"\" and what made them the supposed \"\"authority\"\"?\n",

Fact is that the Britons were in an anti-Angles coalition and the Angles came with their whole volk to defeat them. If the Britons had contact to the former Roman Empire is unclear but possible. They lived under Roman rule for centuries and were romanized. This defeat was something like de-romanizing to them after 500 years of Roman rule.

      "Dammit people, at least let me talk. I believe Thrindel is not editing these pages on the interest of creating a neutral page that informs about all aspects of this comic and its creator. By checking his history and that of these pages you can see that he quickly and simply removes any criticism about either. His knowledge of wikipedia's rules seems to be extensive, but then why have they only edited pages relating to CAD? The nature of his edits, as it has been said, smacks of self interest. I really don't see the need for proving that he is who he is, but it is pretty obvious. For example, posting that he is Buckley on his user talk page will get you banned from the cad forums and Buckley's blog. I'll save you some time Tim, you've already banned this IP.  And this isn't hard to believe since he claims to make a living off income from his comic. For example, in this talk page he suggested that the fact that there are CAD gamer pictures available on xbox live. Those cost money, which means someone is making money. This is not article worthy and the thought of using wikipedia for free advertising would just be low. Ask people a million times to buy them on the cad site, but not here. When money is involved it's completely understandable for him to try and quell any criticism within his power, but this is wikipedia, not a fan site, and defiantly not a site to be edited by the creator of the comic. Leave this page to be edited by the rest of the world to edit. In conclusion, I believe there is an obvious user bias here. There is room for both praise and criticism on the page, if you can find good sources of either that is. Here is one thing I have noticed about the latest comic (although I fear it falls under original research and could not be posted): http://images.google.com/images?q=home+depot+shopper (fifth picture) and http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/comic.php?d=20080321 This confirms one thing I already knew: Tim uses blurred images copied hastily off of google image search for his backgrounds.

      "A little history on this article. Before creating this article I first uploaded images and created categories that relate to this article on Wiki commons under this category \"\"Category:Kura (Japanese saddle)\"\" [Kura_(Japanese_saddle)], this was over one year ago. There has been no objections to the title on Wiki commons.  When I originally named this article I did read the article naming guidelines contained in Wikipedia:Article titles, here are a few quotes from the naming guidelines:(it is sometimes necessary to add distinguishing information, often in the form of a description in brackets after the name.), I did this,  (The choice of article titles should put the interests of readers before those of editors, and those of a general audience before those of specialists.) It seems to me that only a \"\"specialist\"\" would understand what type of saddle a \"\"kura\"\" was, so when I named this article I looked at the list of saddle articles which are now in the category \"\"Saddles by type\"\" and here were saddle articles with titles such as English saddle, Western saddle and Australian Stock Saddle. Looking at these other saddle article titles I decided that Kura (Japanese saddle) would be the best title for this article as anyone who looked at the other articles on saddles could easily and instantly identify what type of saddle the article was about, if I had named the article Kura (saddle) it would not be a descriptive as the other saddle articles and someone with no knowledge of the subject would have to actually click on the title to see what a \"\"Kura\"\" was, with the word \"\"Japanese\"\" added a reader could instantly identify what type of saddle a \"\"Kura\"\" was, much like a reader who saw Australian Stock Saddle, Western saddle or English saddle would have a good idea what that article was about.\n",
      "I have seen \"\"precision\"\" mentioned, I do not understand how having the title as Kura (Japanese saddle) compared to Kura (saddle) goes against any of the guidelines in the section labeled \"\"Precision and disambiguation\"\", WP:PRECISION, if I had named the article \"\"Kura (the saddle of Japan) I would understand but how does Kura (Japanese saddle) go against any naming guidelines, how different is Kura (Japanese saddle) than Australian Stock Saddle? The only difference is some brackets. Here is a quote \"\"Precision – Titles usually use names and terms that are precise (see below), but only as precise as necessary to identify the topic of the article unambiguously.\"\" WP:NAMINGCRITERIA, the title \"\"Kura (saddle) not \"\"precise\"\" as it does not actually identify what type of saddle this is to the \"\"general reader\"\", I would rather have the article named \"\"Japanese saddle\"\" than \"\"Kura (saddle) so that anyone will know instantly what type of saddle this article is about if it is necessary to change the articles title, at least the \"\"general reader\"\" would be able to know what the article is about without having to click on the title as they would with Kura (saddle).    \"\n",

      "The real issue here is that OFSTED reports are primary sources, just as the Crested report is a primary source. We have a situation where editors are each trying to interpret these primary sources and adding their own spin in line with their own opinions. It's really neither here nor there what I think or what Fmph thinks, it is how the primary sources are interpreted in secondary sources that counts. We effectively have original research here where editors are try to interpret these reports themselves and cite from them selectively and not setting the reports in the appropriate context. To answer Sailmfadhley's question, OFSTED reports do sometimes get reported in local newspapers, usually if they receive an outstanding rating or if the school is put into special measures. I can't find any newspaper reports relating to the inspections at Woodleigh. It tends to be the worst-performing schools that attract the attention of secondary sources. For The Ridings School for example it is entirely appropriate to quote from OFSTED reports as they were widely cited in the national press. There might well be a need to cite the latest inspection report but in this case the most recent report is rather brief and focused on issues like flooring, bathing facilities and the general state of the accommodation rather than the education of the pupils. We don't normally include information about such matters in school articles. This is also not by any means a typical OFSTED report. All the OFSTED reports for this school have a much narrower focus than the usual OFSTED reports as they are concerned primarily with the boarding provision and the related health and safety and child welfare issues which in itself offers an unbalanced view of the school. Normally independent schools get inspected by the Independent Schools Inspectorate, but I cannot find any recent report from the ISI.   18:04\n",

I am sorry you had a negative experience with the German Wikipedia, but that is a separate project from this English project. Assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the English Wikipedia; I advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst. I inquired about Silesian/Polish because Silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group. I am not sure what you mean by \"\"reverting the article upside down\"\"; my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles. As I do not anticipate being able to copy-edit the article further, I am removing it from my watchlist. Good luck with the article. Olessi  \n",

To mention nationality is however important, since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation. (Unfortunately, nations or ethnic groups will still exist. I have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them, and fair competition. Seems to me that competition has to exit too – best if for fun only.)\n",
      "I am conscious that English and German Wikipedias are separate projects, but you see, when I approach German Wiki, Dzierzon article the Polish relevant article was attacked by some German/Silesian/Polish guy. It cost me more then here on En Wiki to settle the Pl article well. So sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude, possibly I explained more my excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Silesian is in short like this: Originally, they were Slavic tribe, spoke Polish, as I mentioned. For some 300 to 500 hundred years there were under German governments. They had bad time as you possibly can imagine. Many of them married with German and were/are of course confused who they are. You know, the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course Polish-German conflicts continued. Finally in 1945 Poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives. Even those who honestly considered himself Polish Silesians at the end of war could be persecuted. There in Poland was complete disorder. Soviets and Communists arrived, most of them real simpletons any way. “National” government - just pro-soviet mafia, was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition. Polish borders were shifted. We lost some 20% of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west Poland. You can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all, some of them completely simple people. They spoke different Polish dialect also. On top of this in the post war, pro-soviet atmosphere criminals found good playground. Well, I do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds – unfortunately I am. This is like gangrene on fresh wound, literally. Thus many of the native Silesian could be robber in Poland, which they wanted so much. I believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be Germans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the present time, some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology – they could be absolutely right. However, there are many Germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal Polish affairs - despite the final border agreement between Poland and Germany signed on 14 November 1990 and governments effort to improve relations.\n",
      "Finaly I have to say, I beleave that Polish are hospitable and very often naïve. Not many realize that politic need caution. Those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the naïves. Some procentage remember lectures of history, and objectively, too many Germans are toublemakers. I am also convinced there exists something like national character. You can have obviously you own opinion, let me have my own.\n",

East asians are a mix of altaic mongoloid peoples and sino-tibetans, there is nothing from south asia. However there were many mongol invasions of India so maybe there are some blood relations there, since the mongols were known for their barbarity and rapes.

She also discredits herself with absurd accusations of a White conspiracy to overthrow the Soviet government and even of the rebellion being motivated by anti-semitic racism among the sailors.  Furthermore, all the claims made in that rag are based on a case of begging the question: that is, since Lenin's Communist regime was good (major premise) and the Kronstadt rebellion harmed said regime (minor premise), suppressing the rebellion was justified.  Last but not least, the mere fact that the aforementioned rag was first published by a self-admitted socialist party by definition means that this source DOES NOT meet EITHER WP:NPOV OR WP:RS.

The rest of us have day jobs, so limited time to contribute.  As you probably know from your teaching experiences, repairing student essays take hours of effort and time.  Sincerely said, I just dont think that these unsupervised contributions from students are of the technical or stylistic standards we are accustomed to in Wikipedia.  The graphics are copyright violations, the article are often violate WP:NOTTEXTBOOK and are preachy or making value judgements.  The referencing ignores WP:SECONDARY.  If you find these massive additions, salvageable, then you can join the completely absent instructor in editing.  We really hope that you can help with content!    \n",

This involves an editor who is willing and interested to research and write about the cuisine of Native Hawaiian and to give it an expanded scope and treatment in a larger space.  This means expanding what we already have, not moving it to another article and adding more copypaste from other articles.  Writing means, doing the research, reading the books and scholarly papers, and doing the hard work.  It does not mean taking what we already have and duplicating it over and over again.  That's not how this works.\n",

It has a specific, pre-contact definition and scope.\n",

Of course, I can, since I'm the one that went to the library and found the books and cited them in the original article.  You will have to add each full source to this article, otherwise it will get moved back to draft/sandbox space again.  You can't just keep copying material without doing the hard work.  You will need to add each single full reference to this article.  Don't expect others to cleanup after you, especially when other editors did the actual research and footwork you refuse to do.\n",

The subjects involved, both MHFM and the others mentioned - may seem obscure to the general reader but are figures of note within the theological/philsophical schools of which they represent. The sedevacantist position is of serious interest to those studying the ramifications of Vatican II on the largest single religious denomination on the planet, and stands as a serious challenge to those who accept Vatican II and those who refuse and resist it (such as the Society of Saint Pius X) but still hold that Francis is a legitimate Pope (despite his endorsement of Vatican II). Due to the sedevacantist rejection of contempory Vatican authority it makes sense that there are competing schools within this segment of post Vatican II Catholicism, and in a culture obsessed with concerns such as \"\"What will Amanda Bynes tweet next?\"\" it stands to reason that they are paying much attention to debates over things like the rubrics of the tridentine rite. But it would be a disserve to the goal of the encyclopedia to ignore these intellectual schools of thought.

      "Relating to  (and let me be honest, I'm not up for a protracted debate, I'm just here to offer a perspective that you are free to ignore).  The problem is how you phrased the issue.  If you are claiming admin abuse, you need to be specific.  If you are claiming it is no longer needed, then your opinion of PBS's original ban is irrelevant.  When it comes to General Sanctions, admin are given broad and sweeping authority, because the community wanted them to have a hammer to deal with problems.  Whether you deserved it or not, I have no idea, I didn't do that research and don't have time.  I'm talking about procedure here.  Kosh's comments just muddied the waters, unquestionably admin have the authority to do moratoriums and the like on these articles under General Sanctions, and do topic bans.  Authority isn't debatable because it is clearly spelled out in policy, so Kosh ended up making it less likely others would participate when debating something that is clearly not debatable, and PBS was on topic in addressing those points.  Your points got lost in the mix.  It happens.  And Dougweller and RGloucester also piped in, it wasn't just one person.  It was just one person taking your side, but he was mistaken on the procedural points.  Even DGG jumped in to support the moratorium, and he isn't prone to jump into fires.  Then Obsidi joined the fray.  So 5 people participated, besides yourself, not just one. The problem being that you guys debated the right of the admin to impose sanctions (and he clearly has the right), instead of the circumstances of your situation, which is why 80% of the people disagreed with you and Kosh. You complain that only one admin has spoken, but that isn't true.  Obviously, PBS is an admin, but so is Dougweller and DGG, neither of which has a reputation for being heavy handed.  Quite the opposite, actually.  In reality, he could have put a one year moratorium on name changes and it would have been 100% supported in policy, but he chose a very short and reasonable period.  You might not LIKE it, but the community voted specifically to give admin that power.  If you had not muddied the discussion up by mixing both issues, your topic ban and his authority to issue a moratorium, you would have had a better chance, although odds are that the topic ban would have stuck because there wasn't any abuse in his doing so that I could see.  It was his judgement.  Disagreeing with it doesn't make it abuse. And the fact that it was only three months....that is the shortest topic ban I've ever seen, so obviously he wasn't trying to be heavy handed.  Sometimes, you just have to accept that you don't have a case, and this one could easily be closed as \"\"no consensus to make any changes to existing sanctions\"\".  Again, I'm not up for debating, but I could care less about these articles, and if you want an honest review from an experienced admin, you just read it.  - 2¢ \"\n",

There are millions of ill-informed Hindus who are not empowered to counter argue and hence quietly surrender (and convert).Vegetarianism is an integral part of most schools of Hinduism.

Interestingly a section of home-bred intellectuals claiming to have deep study of ancient India has also come up, who cite references from works of western indologists to vindicate such untrue accusation against the Vedas.The Vedas have not condoned the practice of killing animals anywhere,.

I know some other people seem equally absolutely convinced beyond any doubt that the correct pronunciation is /ɛnˈvɪ.di.ə/ (\"\"en-VID-ee-uh\"\"), and the only explanation I can come up with for this discrepancy is that those people's speech may have the \"\"pin-pen merger\"\" (please go read that if you aren't familiar with the term) — whereas my own speech does not have the pin-pen merger, and I therefore \"\"hear\"\" the pronunciation differently from some other people.

      "It was my impression that El Dorado and the Fountain of Youth were two separate myths.  El Dorado was supposedly a city with a king who wore gold in South America, while the Fountain of Youth was pursued by Ponce de Leon in Florida while he was collecting slaves for the Spanish plantations of the Caribbean.  I am not sure which the author meant, but given the fact that this was on the same continent as the supposed Fountain of Youth, I am going to delete the reference to El Dorado & leave the Fountain of Youth.

      "Interesting...very interesting. Thank you. One of my European ancestors, who was John of Gaunt,had illegitimate children by Katherine Swynford, but then they were legitimated by Royal Assent, and then a following marriage. Since John of Gaunt was a Prince of England, would this have made his children Princes and Princesses of England, given their legitimation? IN Jazmins case, IF (I use IF in a very speculative form) her parents were to marry, would she acquire the title of Princess of Monaco? Also, I understand that she is NOT in the current line of succession, but if her father NEVER had any other children, would it not be possible for him to just write up some documant given Royal Assent to her succession? In my tribe, the legitimate children of a Chief, are automatically given, upon birth, the title of Prince or Princess, however, the first born, regardless of gender, is made the Hereditary Chief/Chieftess. The illegitimate children of a Chief are given the honorific of The Honorable, which is the equivalent usage for the children of our President or Vice President. The illegitimate children of any other Royal or Noble may hold the predicate \"\"of\"\" our tribe, for example: \"\"Ms. Ava Kingston of...\"\"\"\n",

      "\"The problem with saying that Warren G. Harding was the first African-American President is that it is a theory that is unproven by fact.  While many people believe this concept - some even go to great lengths to self publish books on the topics, there is no way to scientifically prove the concept, nor is there any way to verify generally accepted documents that could show this is even a possibility.  The rumor that Harding was black rages about based on two quotes, one by Harding himself (where he says he doesn't know if it could be true, the other a rumor started by his future father-in-law meant to destroy Harding's business and reputation.) Consider verifiable these FACTS on the matter:\n",
      "1) Harding's alleged \"\"black\"\" lineage can not be proven through United States Census forms, death certificate, or any other PRIMARY SOURCE document.  As far back as the 1850 census (the first to name all people enumerated, and designate their race) Harding's father and mother are enumerated as white.  This is most frequently dismissed by Harding Conspiracy followers who claim the census forms were doctored after the fact as part of a Federal Government cover-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) There is no DNA proof of Harding's alleged \"\"black blood\"\", (nor is there proof that Harding fathered Elizabeth Ann Christian).\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Harding was not raised as a cultural \"\"black\"\" that is to say that he was not raised within the black community, and therefore would have not had the same cultural experiences that other blacks in the era would have had.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) \"\"Black Harding\"\" promoters will point to William Estabrook Chancellor's book on Harding as proof of government conspiracy.  And it is interesting how swifty the government worked to squash the book and get its copies.  But if one looks at Chancellor's research methodology (and we step away from those who claim that the book was supressed) - all of it based on hearsay - any student in college today who would present this type of research in the form of a paper, masters thesis or dissertation would have been thrown out of college for faulty research!   \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Some of the promoters of this theory of Harding's \"\"blackness\"\" on \"\"family stories\"\".  While folklore is not always untrue, folklore can be embellished from storyteller to storyteller. Ask anyone who studies it, folklore is at the mercy of the one who passes it on.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) The promoters of these theories go to great lengths to attack the people who poke logical holes in their wishful arguments. They can not refute the facts, so they attack the people who question their beliefs. Take a look at the \"\"reviews\"\" of Harding books published in the past ten years in places like Amazon and B&N; online and you'll get an idea how some people will attack those who do not buy into the black \"\"Black Harding\"\" myth.\n",

      "The Capital maintenance concept \n",
      " \n",
      "The South African Companies Act 61 of 1973 adopts a strange and a curios ambivalence towards the nineteenth-century common law concept of the maintenance of the share capital of a company. In some respects, the Companies Act still clings to this archaic and outdated concept, while in other respects, it boldly sweeps away the concept and replaces it with the more modern twins tests of “liquidity” and “solvency” as a form of creditor protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the capital maintenance concept, the issued share capital of a company is seen as a guarantee fund or a permanent fund intended for the payment of the claims of the creditors of a company, with the result that the issued share capital of a company may not be reduced, nor may it be returned to shareholders except where the Companies Act or the common law authorizes it. Thus, Lord Halsbury, L.C., in The Ooregum Gold Mining Company of India Ltd v Roper,[1] declared that “[t]he capital is fixed and certain, and every creditor of the company is entitled to look to that capital as his security”. This was echoed some eight decades later in Cohen NO v Segal,[2] where the court, in prohibiting the payment of a dividend out of share capital, proclaimed that\n",
      " \n",
      "“[w]hatever has been paid by a member cannot be returned to him and no part of the corpus of the company can be returned to a member so as to take away from the fund to which the creditors have a right to look as that out of which they are to be paid. The capital may be spent or lost in carrying on the business of the company, but it cannot be reduced except in the manner and with the safeguards provided by the statute.”\n",
      " \n",
      "In accordance with this concept, ss.81 and 82 of the Companies Act prohibit a company from issuing its shares at a discount unless certain stringent precautions have been complied with. Section 79 prohibits a company from paying interest on shares out of share capital unless this is authorised by the articles of association of the company or by a special resolution, the interest paid is restricted to a maximum of six per cent per annum, and the approval of the Minister of Industries, Commerce and Tourism has been obtained.\n",

      "\n",
      "These statutory provisions find their roots in the capital maintenance concept, but it no longer makes any sense to preserve them in their present form, because instead of complying with the burdensome requirements of s.79, a company may now simply make a “payment” including dividend payments in terms of s.90 (as amended in 1999), whether out of capital or profits, to its shareholders provided that this is authorised by its articles of association and that it satisfies the tests of “liquidity” and “solvency” (as explained below). A company may, if it so desires, prohibit in its articles of association such “payments”. Section 90 abandons the common law concept of capital maintenance and together with it the fundamental common law principle that dividends may only be paid out of distributable profits. Unlike English law, ss.83 and 84 which regulated reductions of share capital have been repealed by s.8 of the Companies Amendment Act 37 of 1999, with the result that there is no longer any statutory procedure for the reduction of a company’s share capital, expect in accordance with s90 of the Companies Act. Perhaps this conflict in the underlying philosophy and policy of the South African Companies Act is a direct result of the patchwork and piecemeal reform that has taken place in South African corporate law during the 30-year existence of the Companies Act of 1973. By way of contrast, ss.135-141 of the UK Companies Act 1985 have preserved the statutory procedures and regulations relating to reductions of share capital.\n",

      "Another vital aspect of the reform of the capital maintenance concept is the right conferred by s.85 of the Companies Act (as amended by s.9 of the Companies Amendment Act 37 of 1999) to enable companies to purchase their own shares. Until 1999, South African corporate law was one of the few remaining common law jurisdictions which continued to pr\n",

      "Atabek again when you call Kasravi a pan-Iranian nationalists and not acceptable, then I can call Tapper an anthropologist which he is.  If Kasravi is quoted by scholars such as Minorsky, Frye, Savory then his historical works are obviously acceptable.  Also note this: []  Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Sources should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require stronger sources. See Wikipedia:Verifiability#Sources..  Note that is why I quote from Savory a Safavid historian and say that he is stronger source than Tapper who is an anthropologist.  And furthermore I asked for direct proof with regards to your statement.  Actually you quote says: Esmail I proclaimed himself Shah of Azerbaijan.  Now I ask where?  And then you bring me a quote from Tapper who is an anthropologist.  Then I of course say that Savory who is a Safavid historian with much more qualifications does not claim Esmail I made such a proclamation.   It is true that he controlled Gilan also (but perhaps not all of it).. As per Iran , it is mentioned as the country of Safavids by many sources.  Including Sultan Selim I when he attacked Iran. \n",
      " تا ز استانبول لشکر سوی ایران تاختم تاج صوفی غرقه خون و ملامت ساختم.  Thus we have a direct source referring to the country of Esmail I as Iran .  And I do not need to bring direct reference like this because Safavid historians are strong enough source to quote.\n",
      " Note I repeat from the source. Although initially ruler of Azerbaijan only, by the year 916/1510 Esma@¿^l was master of the whole of Persia, having crushed the residual forces of the Aq Qoyunlu and driven the Uzbeks out of the northeastern frontier province of Khorasan..  seems correct but either way it is from strong source.  But until we have proof of proclamation from Esmail I himself  I am the Shah of Azerbaijan, then claiming Esmail I proclaimed himself shah of Azerbaijan is not valid.  He proclaimed himself Shah in Azerbaijan is different though as he was crowned in Tarbiz.  And yes he did own part of Gilan as well, and this angle can be argued from Encyclopedia Islam quote which I have brought above already.  So basically I am asking you for the Minorsky quote you mentioned but quoting from an anthropologist when it contradicts Safavid historians or when Safavid historians are stronger source in my opinion is not valid.  \n",

A corollary of existence existing is that each existing informed mind must think for itself.  So, perhaps you thought I meant that the individual is the final 'creator' of reality.  This is not so.  Regardless of how fleshed out your criteria becomes, criterion by criterion, I must still have to agree with the content of this organizations decisions on who Rand is and what she left to posterity.  If I didn't do so, acting as the final arbitrator of my existence (or my interaction within reality) who will?  Existence and existents hold the validity (or lack thereof) of my perceptions, my concepts, my decisions, consequences of my ethics, etc.  Not Wikipedia.  Certainly not you who thinks such a thought nonsense.  And I have all her texts, I'm quite aware of her ideas. Making assumptions without checking on premises is what landed Rand's page in this editing nightmare.  Also, Rand didn't form the thought Existence exists (existence qua existence) or A is A, Aristotle did.  She resurrected the import of the phrase and logically extended the consequences.  Its been fun.  ~RJM\"\n",

The persian spelling is originally from Ilkhanid times and we see diverse spelling like Airavan, Irevan, Erevan and much more. The spelling used by EI is one I adopted. I thought it would be easy just to say Yerevan, but seems people are upset. I know Encyclopedia of Islam (English and Turkish version) will have articles about this and also the book by the American scholar Bournotian as someone above mentioned. His work is considered the most important work and most authorative on the topic and is a big book opposed to several page article in iranian encyclopedia. Also, anyone who studies this state will affeliate it with nothing but Persian empire of Safavids and Qajars and anyone between,. I studied bournoutian book beofre and he spends a lot to explain about ethnic groups of persians, kurds, armenians, and Turkic tribes (dozens!) with specific names and islaimc denominations, I think Qizil Bash, Qara Qoyunli (tribe name, not to be confused with famous states and organization associated with names), these Turkic people were not referred to as Azeris, but muslim tribesmen.

The copyright violations seemed blatant to my eyes, shocking for an OTRS volunteer granting verification tickets to images. This was self-evident even looking at the first 20 thumbnails, some of which had been marked as copyright problems previously. Commons is short of experienced copyright reviewers, when we spot problems we ought to mark it for review, it is not like I was deleting them on sight, I am leaving the review to others. If you wish to discuss Ktr101's uploads to Commons, I suggest that happens on Commons.\n",

Second of all, I'm of English and Spaniard descent who is sensitive to the falsehoods thus far stated in wiki pages concerning the English and Spaniards. For example, one of these falsehoods covers the notion that the Welsh population is huge in Argentina when in reality it is not as significant at all in numbers as the author of the 'Argentina' piece makes it out to be. Another false notion within the same piece - both explicit and implied - is that Italians are the majority ethnic race in Argentina, when again, the numbers show this is not the case. These and other idiocies which aren't true exemplify the need to update the info therein. Third of all, I read your bio. With all due respect, according to your ethnic background, you're not qualified to dictate the origins of other nation's histories, especially Euopean. I know my English and Spaniard history. You don't. I may sound like I'm talking out of line here, but seriously, I'm not. Don't take offense as I state the facts as I see them. This is why modification is necessary.

      "Its not that virtue ethicists today would accept Aristotle's particular understanding of human nature and, by consequence, his table of virtues- but rather that they are willing to pursue the virtues via an understanding of man qua animal, which MacIntyre rejects.  That is, the project of virtue ethics today is not just the uncovering of one's social roles and an embodiment of the excellences which one's social narrative provides as MacIntyre conceives of it in After Virtue.  Most contemporary virtue ethicists would object to such a socially situated view of human nature and instead favor a return to the Aristotelian project of examining the essential nature of man.  It seems to me that MacIntyre is more important in the development of communitarian philosophy for which his virtue ethics was tailored.  Besides, GEM Anscombe wrote the article \"\"Modern Moral Philosophy\"\" in 1958, which it seems to me is what really kicked things off for contemporary virtue ethics.\"\n",

You are going to have to come up with some citations which realistically and accurately show that the northern accent originated in or is unique to the Midwest, before I'kk allow you continue deleting my writings without a fight. It certainly is not unique to the Midwest, a region which was not even settled by English speakers until barely 150 years ago, after the northern accent was known to exist in places like Pennsylvania and upstate NY, and Connecticut. It really bugs me to see the Midwest taking ownership of an accent which began in the Northeast. The original author blunders badly by lumping the accents of certain urban areas of the northeast in with the rural areas. Anybody from my region, the Syracuse, NY area, formerly Albany, NY, knows that our accent it totally indistinguishable from that of the Midwest. I challange anybody to put a group of Midwestern speakers side-by-side with upstate New Yorkers, and tell which is which. It's impossible, it's the same accent, utterly and completely the same. And we've been speaking this way since before the Midwest was even settled, so it's nonsense to say it's a Midwest accent.\"\n",

I was however quite exhausted from doing a lot of grappling and picking myself up off the floor numerous times. In my style, Shotokan, the philosophy is to take out an opponent with one blow (ippon) so as to be ready for any others, but we still train in grappling and escapes quite a lot. The movements in any kata can be interpreted in many ways, from the obvious to very complex applications from apparently simple movements.

      "\n",
      "Hello: having worked on Angola for more than four decades, I have over the last two years or so tried to improve articles on Angola in WP (several languages). I was thus delighted to see your recent work on the en:WP article on the Angolan Civil War, which is a period I have somewhat neglected with regard to the military side. I wonder whether we can agree on the following points:\n",
      " The civil war in Angola ran from 1975 to 2002. The war for independence stopped effectively in April 1974, although a formal peace agreement was signed in January 1975 only. What I call the \"\"decolonization conflict\"\" is the fight between the nationalist movements & allies from April 1974 to November 1975 (independence). This conflict becomes a civil war after independence. Civil war can be divided in two periods: until 1991 (Cuban and South African military involvement) and 1991-2002 (external support only). I think this periodization is important, because it permits to specify the participation of other countries.\n",
      " There was direct participation of Cuba and SA in the fighting in 1974/75 as well as in 1975-1991. \n",
      " I have never heard of the involvement of French & Morroccan troops: what are your sources? \n",
      " The support of the Soviet Union consisted of air transport for Cuban troops, furnishing military equipment, and a few advisors, mostly in 1974/75, less in 1975-1991.\n",
      " Zaire supported the FNLA (logistics, equipment) and (small) contingents of troops, mainly in 1974/75, less so in 1975-1991 (when, as far as I know, the FNLA ceased it military activity as early as 1976/77)\n",
      " The US gave UNITA logistical, material and diplomatic support 1975-1991.\n",
      " China gave the FNLA some (unspecified) support in the early 1960s, and shifted this support (which then included military training in China for come cadres) to UNITA after 1966. This is uncontested  see e.g. John Marcum's book.\n",
      " Algeria supported the MPLA 1961-1974, mainly by hosting a pivotal group of MPLA exile cadres. I don't know about any further support.\n",
      " I don't have any sources on Libyan involvement.\n",
      " I am quite surprised at you mentioning the FNLC: what are the sources?\n",
      " Gabon and Côte d'Ivoire: I don't have sources, either.\n",
      " Mozambique: the FRELIMO regime has given \"\"fraternal\"\" moral and diplomatic support to the MPLA from the 1960s onwards, but as far as I know, there was no military involvement (so much the less as there was a civil war going on in Mozambique as well).\n",

Hence the Dominions declared war independently of Britain in 1939 (and the Irish Free State, which was a Dominion at the time, remained neutral). Britain is not even a \"\"first among equals\"\".

In fact, for most of the war, the vast majority of Australian forces served under Douglas MacArthur in the South West Pacific Area, rather than under British commanders anywhere else. \n",

The current way to determine what is a top or second tier organization puts full weight on the rankings, while your system gives minimal weight to it. I think we should find a middle ground, while at the same time keep things as simple as possible. In order to do so, I would scrap criteria 3 and 8, and use a criteria based on rankings determined by Fight Matrix. That criteria could amount to 1/3 or 1/2 of all possible points. The advantages would be that the main organizations would certainly be ahead of other, while at the same time event short lived but notable organizations would have a high score. By using Fight Matrix, we would be able to easily determine how many points defunct organizations would have. Maybe we could present such a system as a possible substitute to the current way we use to determine notability?\n",

My suggestion is per a growing trend on Wikipedia: Link sobriquet to a definition in Wiktionary, should one exist. This saves readers the hassle of going through an entire article trying to summarily grasp the full definition of one word within an article comprised of several thousand such words. Furthermore, if Wikipedia is meant to be an informal learning tool of sorts, why fear incorporating a higher grade-level vocabulary into it as a means of providing the best possible learning experience? And if we have to \"\"dumb down\"\" a word here, the same precedent would theoretically have to be set for the entire English Wikipedia, thereby degrading the quality of articles. As someone pointed out, if readers cannot grasp the lingusitics of the standard English wikipedia, there's Simple English to cater to that need. So, that's my offer for a solution. Dictionaries are as important of a resource as an encyclopedia and complement one another: Get the information you want and if you don't know what a word means, just look it up.\n",

      "Nothing personal Radh, I appreciate the input. My rant is directed at Toa mostly. I realize, Tao, you are being a smart ass as if my suggestion is not practical. You like to use so called wikipedia rules to hide your empty, meaningless claims. How about this for a rule: 1) before you comment on other people, read what they say; 2) before you comment on the page, read the page. You seem to refuse to do either and continue to make smart ass comments for what seems to be the sole purpose of antagonizing well intentioned posters. You have refused to do the one thing necessary to anyone who genuinely intends to help imporove this page: actually read the page and actually read others' comments. While I believe Radh is well intentioned, he or she partly suggests things that already exist on the page (please see the \"\"writers\"\" section, what used to be the lead section which Doom, who has been working ont his page for a very long time, moved lower  both Doom and I have been working on this page a very long time; both Doom and I have actually read the page because both Doom and I have actually written much of this page; the comments Doom and I make on the discussion page are well intentioned, practical, and based on knowledge of the page, none of which applies to your comments, Tao). Not only have your comments suggested a stubborn refusal to actually read the page or read the comments of others; they also demonstrate a pervasive hypocricy and your comments thoroughly contradict one another. I suggested mention of the abstract expressionists as a part of broader concept of the beat generation and you go ape shit. Radh suggests it and it's an excellent and practical solution. It makes no sense to me. I can't help thinking you have tourettes or something, finger tourettes, that causes you to be incapable of typing anything but bullshit.\n",
      "Now a direct response to Radh. What I am suggesting is an accurate, middle-of-the-road definition. They are not simply ideas.  Please read my comments above. According to sources I found through a search method intended to eliminate prejudice, \"\"beat generation\"\" means most commonly a subculture, not a close circle. I'm not suggesting we change the page to focus less on the close circle. I'm suggesting we change it to more accurately represent the truth so that certain dumbasses have context with which to argue whether or not someone belongs in the group. If someone says there is no such thing as a beat artists, we can point at reliable sources and point to places on the page that clear this up in a neutral, accurate way. So, while I appreciate your good intentions, Radh, this is not an \"\"excellent and practical solution\"\" because it's not an actual change  which would be clear to certain other posters if they actually read the article. Here, I'll make it easy for you Tao: Beat Generation.  It's just right there.  One click away. Take ten minutes, take an hour, whatever. Being an effective smartass means being a well informed smartass.  \"\n",

      "I've never before seen someone else write about an \"\"American ethnicity\"\" the same way I have thought about it. I know that the Southeast has the greatest number of people declaring their ethnicity as American, but I think this ethnic label would apply to the majority of racially White Americans and not just those in the Southeast. The Americans (outside of the South) that descended from pre-20 c. immigrants from the UK, Ireland, and Germany seem to have substantially = meshed together into a \"\"White ethnic group\"\", not just racially, but ethnically as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only cultural differences between ethnic Whites of the North (where 19c. immigrants mostly settled) and those of the South is that the South still experiences religion and social conservatism as very influential forces on daily life. Where for the more recent ethnic Whites, this is not the case (e.g. in the North). So, the distinctive cultural aspects of the South have not been adopted by the ethnic Whites of the North even with several centuries having passed. I do not want to make false generalizations, however this is my sense of the average situation in those regions based on my travels and time spent living here. \n",
      "\n",
      "The areas where distinct ethnic identity has been conserved is in the major cities. The city-centred ethnic groups in the US have preserved a substantial part of their culture in absence of preserving their language (for the most part). A few well-known examples would be the Irish- and Italian-Americans of the Northeast. So long as their numbers are high enough to have a large enough community - cultural traditions endure. What I am getting at is that so long as a Ukrainian-American stays in a major city s/he has no reason to be forced into completely adopting a new ethnicity. S/he won't have to abandon the culture of his/her community. If s/he were to move to an area in the Southeast, then it would be a completely different story. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to give you a further illustration - the Poles of Chicago. Most arrived somewhere between the 1850s and 1940s or so. Many have had families there for well over a century. There has been very limited migration out of Chicagoland for this period and the Polish community there has remained extremely strong. So there is not much past observation that would suggest that cities are only an entry point from which ethnic communities later break-down as they go their own ways. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've written all of this to demonstrate how the \"\"ethnic Americans\"\" and people who ethnically (not racially, but ethnically) identify as \"\"White\"\" are distinct ethnically from the more recent (post-1850) European ethnic communities in the major cities. I find it all very interesting. The only problem that sometimes arises is when individuals do not make the distinction between an \"\"Ameican\"\"/\"\"US citizen\"\" and an \"\"ethnic American\"\" and in so doing sometimes end up labeling certain individuals as being un-American. These people, that do not make the distinction, show frustration when a person does not abandon his/her culture and adopt their own. This is of course on an individual-by-individual basis and I would not generalize this in any way to any region or sub-region.\n",

      "I've seen ethnic hostilities projected towards myself or family/friends from people of all sorts of backgrounds. I've seen it demonstrated by Southerners, New Yorkers, and even Jews in South Florida. By the way, most of the time my ethnicity (and that of family/friends) would have been indeterminable by those people. I'm saying this because I don't want to suggest that any particular regional group of Americans is more racist/discriminant than another region. I've spent a lot of time in South Florida and the racist attitudes that come from some of the people there have been really surprising at times especially when you take into account that many of those racists that I have come across would themselves been the target of racism less than 50 years ago. Its all unfortunate and these types of racist, discriminatory, and nationalistic attitudes are probably present in most countries. \n",

However, in the interests of mutual understanding, permit me to clarify a few things. Creation or origin accounts are only important in one minor branch of Christianity (I cannot speak for Islam). And there are in fact multiple books and multiple versions of the bible in Christianity-not as many as Hinduism perhaps, but in the hundreds for sure-all interpreted differently by different sects. This is how there come to be several tens of thousands of sects of Christianity. And it is true that some branches of Christianity will charge others with blasphemy for not agreeing with them, but again this is only true of a small segment. The difficulty rests in the rather visible and vocal minority causing trouble. I suspect similar things might be true of Islam as well.\n",

      "The J.D. is not a doctoral level degree. That someone chooses to call it that means nothing. There is at least one college that calls all of it B.S.-level alumnae \"\"doctor\"\" because of some tradition, akin to the Italian use of Dottore. Everyone agreed that the old D.Pharm., before the recent changes, was a master's-level degree. When I see surveys of \"\"highest level of education completed\"\" I often see the J.D. lumped with professional master's degrees like a M.Arch. (usually 2-3 years) or M.S.W. or the like. The D.C. was often lumped in there, but they're made an effort to get more people to have completed a B.S. first to raise their standing, as pharmacy is trying to do. As mentioned, in many fields the terminal degree is a master's, for example in many artistic fields (M.F.A.). I clearly recall arguments, reported in The Chronicle of Higher Ed., over whether a J.D. holder should be a university's president given the lack of a terminal/doctoral degree. I also point out that following a J.D. one still takes a master's or (higher) doctorate as the next step, if desired. In my experience, J.D. holders occasionally use \"\"Doctor\"\" in very formal settings in academiaif speaking at a graduation ceremonybut for the most part, no. Certainly, I consider them to have a degree that is the equivalent of a 3-year M.Arch. Since there is no pre-law curriculum, it just isn't comparable  to a Ph.D. biologist who took a B.S. and M.S. in the same subject.  \"\n",

      "Aristotle himself called the Spartans a monarchy numerous times in the Politics.  I don't understand why you keep trying to call them a republic.  Furthermore, your comments above don't seem any improvement to me on the language in the article now, which is very clear that republics come in many shapes and sizes (in fact, limiting them all to two so-called models seems more restrictive to me than it should be).  Use of the words \"\"genus\"\" and \"\"species\"\", as I've remarked to you before, is a misapplication of taxonomy to political science.  It may be useful for purposes of casual analogy, but we cannot resort to it in an encyclopedia article, or we will confuse and mislead our readers.  You have yet to demonstrate that any authority refers to a government such as that current in the United Kingdom as a republic.  As noted in this paragraph, Aristotle himself describes Sparta as a monarchy  one in which the monarch held weakened powers, yes, but fundamentally part of the \"\"monarchy\"\" category.  Your ideas have the merit of being an unusual take on republics which has given all of us cause to consider political terminology, but I am afraid your quotations, though well cited, do not appear to me to compel us to accept your two model theory of republics  it's original research, something Wikipedia is not.   20:37, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)\"\n",

As for this discussion, I really havn't even been editing the article or really following the changes as closely as others have been.  This discussion is so time consuming!  When I first ran accross the article I was deeply concerned with the slant, but there has been a lot of work.  I still have issues with using the word \"\"official\"\", since only 424 persons out of 2,411 (approximately 18%) who attended the IAU assembly even voted on the issue and there are enough published articles showing the controversy that the vote has caused.  With that said, the introductory paragraph does a good job at mentioning the lack of a historical scientific agreement for the definition of planet.  This balance may be sufficient to show all sides on this debate.  I might like it if it was the \"\"official scientific body\"\", because surely there are no other organizations that can make that claim and it still leaves room for \"\"unofficial cultural definitions\"\", such as those widely used by the general public. Ironically, I think the article may now focus a little too much attention on the naming controversy.  I would put \"\"Definition\"\" and \"\"Disagreement\"\" under the main heading of \"\"Etymology\"\".  I think it would flow better and put less emphasis on the controversy.  Afterall, the definition of the word is what Etymology is all about, and the controversy occurred chronologically after the information currently under the heading of Etymology. —  (comment)  \n",

It also refers to \"\"[s]pecific military installations in Dresden in February 1945 included barracks and hutted camps and at least one munitions storage depot\"\", (see para II.10). Perversely, one of the arguments suggested for legitimising the bombing was the fact that Dresden \"\"was protected by antiaircraft defenses, antiaircraft guns and searchlights\"\", (see para 11).

It is also pointed out that the important Autobahn bridge to the west of the city was not targeted or attacked and that no railway stations were on the British target maps, nor were the bridges, such as the railway bridge spanning the Elbe River.McKee (1982), pp.62,63. Commenting on this Alexander McKee stated that: \"\"The standard whitewash gambit, both British and American, is to mention that Dresden contained targets X, Y and Z, and to let the innocent reader assume that these targets were attacked, whereas in fact the bombing plan totally omitted them and thus, except for one or two mere accidents, they escaped\"\"McKee (1983), p.61. McKee further asserts, \"\"The bomber commanders were not really interested in any purely military or economic targets, which was just as well, for they knew very little about Dresden; the RAF even lacked proper maps of the city. What they were looking for was a big built up area which they could burn, and that Dresden possessed in full measure\"\"McKee (1983), p.63.\n",

R. Allen said, \"\"The final phase of Bomber Command's operations was far and away the worst.

This is very different from the multi-dimensional Nolan Chart style libertarian business.  I would also add that Schlesinger, as a historian of the United States, a country which has never seen viable communist or fascist movements, would seem a poor choice as a specialist to quote.  The point of Schlesinger is not to dispute that fascism is on the right wing of the classic political spectrum, but to suggest that the classic political spectrum itself is somewhat problematic due to these supposed similarities of communism and fascism.\n",

I think it would be very difficult to provide an authorative article on the \"\"Doctrines of William Branham\"\" because there are so many different views among his followers (of whom I am one!).   I think WB's most controversial doctrines among other churches are probably the Trinity, serpent seed, and the role of women. A general overview of these and other subjects would be good.  Weaver's book is not without its own bias (\"\"Branham was a victim of his own illusions\"\", 2000,p173) and errors (\"\"He believed that the final manifestation of his gift would transform physical bodies into the glorified ones necessary for the rapture\"\", 2000, p173).  Some of Weaver's conclusions can be easily disproved by reference to the over 1,000 audio sermons and transcripts online.   It is also worth noting that WB had more in common with the evangelical and pentecostal churches than is often realized because the focus is usually only on differences.   \n",

Every other opinion is a misinterpretation of facts by racist bigots. Well, there are few seemingly racial clusters appearing in recent genetic studies, and they very well agree with the classical anthropological division of humans. Furthermore, when geographical distance is constant, the genetic distance between groups within these clusters is several times lower than between groups from different clusters. The main detected bareers of genetic flow are also consistent with the borders of traditional races. Moreover, the genetic distances between these clusters are typical for mammals routinely divided into subscpecies by biologists.

      "No I am not missing the point; I am disagreeing with you. Since he still uses a regnal name, the \"\"other clergy\"\" argument doesn't fly. He was a pope and is pope emeritus, so his article's title should remain as close to the established convention as possible. The fact that he stepped down is not a compelling reason to drastically deviate. Nothing in what you say makes any logical argument for why \"\"Benedict XVI\"\" is the best form for a pope emeritus. In other words, in the formulation \"\"Because X, the unmodified regnal name is the most appropriate for a pope emeritus\"\", you have yet to supply X. This seems to be more about your personal preference than rules or logic. Also, since the article should match the other popes after he dies, what we are really talking about is what to call him while he is alive. Does it really make sense to drop \"\"Pope\"\" then add it back? What is the difference? Keeping the article where it is no more suggests he is the current pope than Pope John Paul II does or that Queen Victoria suggests she remains a current monarch. Even in the unlikely situation that someone arrived here from \"\"Random article\"\" and momentarily thought he was still pope, that would be cured immediately by the lead, the resignation section, and the discussion of his pontificate in the past tense. No case has been made for this change, so I don't see why you expect everyone to agree to make it. -  \"\n",

So this unblock request is, for all intents and purposes, the only way I can inquire about this. There has to be one administrator who is on the level in this place. Why was I blocked, when I had not the right, but rather the duty to remove BLP inaccuracies? Why was I not given a chance to defend myself at the administrator's noticeboard, even though the complaintant never notified me after making the report, as required? Why has  an article, when policy clearly states that is not permissable? I've made a lot of good contributions to this encyclopedia, and I enjoy it. I'm willing to chalk my experience with Spike Wilbur up to one bad apple in the bunch. I realize admins stick together, and I get the fact that no one is willing to go over another administrator's head, and unblock me. The fact is User:Therefore has clearly broken 3RR. I have a hard time believing that any one user could have every single administrator here in his pocket? Spike Wilbur should see that this user has broken the same rule, at the same article. Obviously he's not going to do anything to rectify a situation that he created. I don't care about being unblocked. If Therefore is blocked, it will go a long way towards restoring my respect for this project. Is there one fair administrator here who will at least answer the questions I have posed?]]\n",

In fact and operation, the complex cooperative management of The Great Lakes for purposes of trade, border discipline, parks, transportation, hydro-power, water management and environmental protection has been a reality since 1815.   Ethnically and economically, the borders have always been porous.   Politically, the region has more bi-national commonalities than generally supposed.    Much of Ontarian political culture derived from both Anglo-American heritage and the simultaneous influence and threat of American examples.   More importantly, both the American and Canadian sides played analogous roles in the world-economy.   Both sides of the border transformed from peripheries that supplied natural resources; to semi-peripheries that performed middle-man brokerage functions; to core regions, represented by such world cities as Chicago and Toronto, that provided hubs of capital, administration, and management.   History, politics, culture, and ethnic composition, as well as the more obvious economy, technology, and geology, define Ontario and American Great Lakes states as one region.  04:11, 27 January 2009\n",

Again, there remain very few facts that we can associate with GG overall short of what's in the current History section - it is a war of opinions here, that's why its a controversy.  Further FRINGE states we give fringe views a neutral, fair treatment with the associated weight of ink they get from RS. So because ethics claims have been discussed, if not then debunked by the authors in the next breath, in these highly reliable sources, we can discuss them in a non-prejudging way and then later include the criticism of them; that's how we meet all content policies. End of the day we cannot appear to take a side in the GG issue, and everything you have said above is against that point. And that I'm \"\"trying to use an avalanche of incredibly negative stories\"\" to say its about ethics is 100% wrong. I'm trying to introduce the required impartiality into the article per NPOV. I don't necessarily believe at the end of the day GG is about ethics, but they have presented that as their case, and as we are an impartial encyclopedia, we should include any facets of their case that have been appropriately documented in highly reliable sources. Failure to do so is showing a partial view of the story. The fact that these claims are made in negatively-charged stories doesn't matter, they are stated in what everyone here is considering as highly reliable sources; most of what we know about Westboro Baptist Church, for example, comes from highly-negative sources about the congretation, but we still can document what the church claims about itself from them.

Thanks for keeping an eye on some articles.  I see Sharon Tate is up for discussion.  I think another good example is Anne Frank.  If Anne had lived, her diary may never have even been published, and had it been published it may have failed to attract the audience that it is has.   Her notability is unquestionably linked not only to her death, but the reaction to it.   I don't attempt to put Sharon in the same category, but the principal is the same.

Virtually any image benefits from lines echoing the delineation of the (usually rectangular) image. This is somewhat similar to the way scare quotes call attention to a word or phrase. The scare quotes are setting off that word or phrase for special consideration. We have a vested interest in trying to get the reader to take special notice of each image of artwork that we include in an article. If we are going to argue that Wikipedia is not an art gallery or that these thumbnails are hardly impressive in their dimensions and scarceness of detail, then why bother including images of famous paintings at all? I think we all agree that the images are all educational in an art historical kind of way.

      "\n",
      "I referred to the scientist Brad Watson and his discoveries of 7 cutting-edge theories that he claims are the \"\"7 Seals\"\" on the cover of his booklet There Are No Coincidences - there is synchronism, design and alignment. I see that Watson has posted on this article and talk page before. Not more than 60 seconds elapsed before Doug Weller came along and not only deleted Science: 7 Seals as 'beyond Einstein theories' from the article, he deleted it from this talk page! That's against the rules of Wikipedia as I understand them. The scientific explanation of the 7 Seals appears to me to be much more logical, legitimate, and a 21st century interpretation/explanation than anything else in this article. It belongs here in the Wikipedia article and that's why I put it here. In a message to me, he attacks Richard Bradshaw Watson II and says \"\"not to use him as a source anymore\"\". That's outrageous! There's a strong prejudice coming from Doug Weller and it's doing a great harm to this very important Wikipedia article and talk page. - Einstein 75.74.130.115  \"\n",

The mistake in attributing the P source (the last half of Exodus, all of Leviticus, much of early Genesis, etc) to postexilic times has made hash of much of the secular (history-minded) Torah-interpretation that I grew up with, and I am grateful to Friedman for helping me set matters straight.

The title is objective, and the objection to it seems to be only that it doesn't adequately conform to Laval's own beliefs about what is motivating the contributors to this article.

      "A person doesn't have to vote to voice an opinion. The instructions at the top of every poll state \"\"Please remember that this survey is not a vote\"\", so the fact that I've inferred opinions from other parts of the debate is not a problem. It seems that 205.157.110.11 (an IP, but one with a very strong history of contructive edits) would have made an explicit vote were it not for the hot-headed wording of the proposal, and GTBacchus (an editor who I have yet to see make a mistake) also supported a very similar title. Laval, the move's proponent supported his move, of course; tjstrf proposed an alternative title, which garnered little support, and \"\"Marc Gévry\"\" commented more on the debate than the title. This makes 3 \"\"votes\"\" in favour of \"\"Anti-Quebec sentiment[s]\"\", and one (yourself) directly opposed. Characterising votes for alternative titles as either support or opposition for the quoted proposal cannot be accurately done, so I omitted those from the count (but took them into consideration for the decision, of course).\n",
